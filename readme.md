## Overview
This project is a multi-page website showcasing five themed hero sections, each inspired by a different pop culture or aesthetic. The main design direction is cyberpunk/lofi with a retro pixel-art twist. Each page includes a navigation system for seamless exploration and uses a unified font and style base, while still embracing the uniqueness of each hero theme.

Theme: High-speed Formula 1 racing
Design Approach:
Inspired by the adrenaline and energy of modern F1 events
Features bold typography, red-and-black contrasts, and sleek racing visuals
Uses motion graphics or animated GIFs that suggest speed and precision
Purpose: To represent energy, speed, and precision in digital design
Font/Color: Futuristic bold sans-serif, with racing-stripe effects and minimal color accents (red/black/white)
Mood: Fast-paced, competitive, cutting-edge

Theme: Pokémon universe, specifically Riolu
Design Approach:
Features a calming background with a pixel-art Riolu scene or a dynamic sprite
Gentle blues and bright yellows reflect Riolu’s color scheme
Text is styled with a fun, game-like font (still keeping consistency with the main pixel theme)
Purpose: To showcase nostalgia and youth through a character-driven layout
Font/Color: Rounded, playful, pixel-style type; blue, white, and light yellow palette
Mood: Adventurous, nostalgic, lighthearted

Theme: Netflix's Stranger Things
Design Approach:
Dark 80s horror aesthetic with red neon text, VHS static effects, and a moody background
Fonts resemble the Stranger Things title (Cinzel or similar serif)
Layout mimics a poster-style intro, with emphasis on date, rating, and story snippet
Purpose: To explore dark retro themes in a modern layout
Font/Color: Classic serif, all caps, red text glow on black/dark backgrounds
Mood: Suspenseful, eerie, cinematic

Theme: Classic arcade – Pac-Man
Design Approach:
Uses bright yellow Pac-Man iconography and 8-bit ghosts
Background mimics an arcade maze or blinking dots
Animations or hover effects reflect classic gameplay
Purpose: To bring classic arcade culture into web design
Font/Color: Pixel-perfect font, bright primary colors (yellow, blue, red) on black
Mood: Fun, interactive, retro-gaming

Theme: Modern youth, streetwear & tech culture
Design Approach:
Cyberpunk-inspired with neon lights, digital overlays, and glitch aesthetics
Represents Gen Z identity—creativity, self-expression, and connection
May include lofi city visuals, glitch text effects, and bold expressive slogans
Purpose: To reflect the evolving identity of digital-native youth
Font/Color: Bold pixel font + neon blue, pink, and purple; stylized overlays
Mood: Rebellious, expressive, digital-forward

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
